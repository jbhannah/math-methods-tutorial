## Development

### Requirements

  * LaTeX
  * GNU Make

### Building

    $ make

Or:

    $ make pdf

which is the default `make` task.

Or:

    $ pdflatex main.tex

Run `pdflatex` twice if any changes to chapters or sections have taken place for
table of contents to be updated. `make` does this for you.
